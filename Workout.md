I skipped Monday and Wednesday because you mentioned a **6-day workout plan**, and I assumed those days might be for other muscle groups (e.g., upper body, lower body, etc.).  

Now, let’s **structure all 6 days properly**, ensuring every muscle group is trained while including **running, core, cycling, and push-ups.**
